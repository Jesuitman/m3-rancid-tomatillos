## üí≠ Abstract
The project is designed to bolster expertise in React fundamentals, asynchronous JavaScript, refactoring, and multi-page user experiences with Router. It's structured into iterative phases to facilitate learning and progress.

Iteration 0 involves setting up the project essentials, establishing team relationships, defining architecture, and gathering design inspiration.
Iteration 1 focuses on displaying movies using mock data, concentrating on React fundamentals to showcase all movies upon app access.
Iteration 2 implements conditional rendering to exhibit details of a selected movie, emphasizing the transition from the main view to specific movie details.
Iteration 3 refactors the project by integrating real data from a database, adding PropType checks, and incorporating error handling for server responses.
Iteration 4 emphasizes the transition to React Router for view management and adds Cypress tests to ensure proper functionality.

The final phase focuses on implementing filter buttons, enabling users to categorize movies by ratings for a more efficient viewing experience, an experience we personally selected to ensure use state manipulation expereince

## üçé Context
We worked fast to make sure we could tackle each challenge early and give plenty of time for refactoring and error handling. We were given 10 days to work on the project and spent about 50 hours totla between the both of us making sure it worked. The most difficult part was the cypress testing which was a lot of new syntax to learn.

## üñáÔ∏è Learning Goals
### React Fundamentals Mastery: 
Develop a strong understanding of React basics, including component structure, state management, props handling, and lifecycle methods.

### Asynchronous JavaScript Proficiency: 
Gain expertise in asynchronous programming in JavaScript, focusing on handling asynchronous operations, promises, async/await, and API requests.

### Refactoring Techniques: 
Learn and apply best practices for refactoring code, emphasizing improved readability, maintainability, and performance without altering its external behavior.

### Router Implementation: 
cquire skills in implementing multi-page user experiences using React Router, effectively managing and navigating between different views within the application.

### Data Handling and Management: 
Understand efficient data storage methodologies within React applications, exploring options like state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Context API).

### Error Handling and Testing Strategies: 
Develop strategies for handling errors within the application, implementing error boundaries, and comprehensive testing using tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit testing.

### API Integration and Data Fetching: 
Gain hands-on experience in integrating APIs with React applications, focusing on fetching and managing real data from external sources.

### Collaborative Project Management: 
Enhance collaboration and communication skills within a development team, utilizing tools like Git, GitHub, and project boards for effective task management and version control.

## üéÜ Wins && üî• Challenges#
### Wins:
#### Lex: 
My big win for this project was getting the posterback to show when click, adding in the animation for flipping the poster was such a small thing but it felt incredible. I also was really happy when i finished the indidual poster movie view
#### Brendan:
My win for this project was understanding and implementing the Routes setup. I was able to get the titles of our movies posters to route to a new page that had access to the more detailed
data for that movie.

### Challenges: 
#### Lex: 
The biggest challenge I experienced was getting Cypress to work. Once I got it working I felt so much relief. Getting to that point was a fight though.
#### Brendan:
The biggest challenge I faced was having the components properly managed and split up. Initially we had too much of our app running in the APP component and it was hard to work around that.
Eventually we moved it out of APP and that was helpful.

## üìù Observations && ‚ùì Questions
### Observations: 
#### Lex: 
This project was a lot of new technology to learn and use while implementing it. I really enjoyed the challenge and I cannot wait to get more use out of it.
#### Brendan:
The project gave us a lot of freedom to explore a new technology and it was interesting trying to think how to do tasks without using eventlisteners and queryselectors.

### Questions: 
#### Lex: 
I have been having issues with getting the cypress tests to pass because the filtered movie views rarely all pass at once. it feels very random and im not sure why. maybe you could provide some help for me Kayla?
